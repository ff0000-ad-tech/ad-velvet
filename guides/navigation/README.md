This is a general overview for what the Navigation and most common principle UI of Velvet is. The example shown in the Fig 1 is all the way down into the Ad Data level.

# Fig 1.
## ![Velvet Navigation](images/velvet_nav_navigation_adData.jpg)
Whether looking at Ad Data or Segments or Locales or Time Blocks, the basic logic remains consistent: A= b.1, B= c.1, C= d.1, etc


<dl>
<dt>Fig 1.A. (<i>Client name</i>) or Fig 1.b.1- Return to the root Clients menu containing all available Campaigns for the Client</dt>

<dd><img width=728 src="images/velvet_nav_campaigns.jpg" /></dd>
<br>

<dt>Fig 1.B.(<i>Campaign name</i>) or Fig 1.c.1- Return to the root level of the Campaign, which has that Campaign's Locale, Template, and Creativeinformation</dt>

<dd><img width=728 src="images/velvet_nav_campaign_locales.jpg" /></dd>
<br>

<dt>Fig 1.C.(<i>Locale name</i>) or Fig 1.d.1- Return to the root level of that Locale, which has that Locale's Ad Dataand Segments</dt>

<dd><img width=728 src="images/velvet_nav_locales.jpg" /></dd>
<br>

Fig 1.D.(<i>Current Content name</i>) Navigate to the content you're currently looking at
</dl>

Fig 1.E.No function - describes the process you're currently undertaking (editing an Ad Datain this case)

Fig 1.F.The state of your Ad Data. Can be <i>UNPUBLISHED<i>, <i>APPROVED<i>, or <i>PUBLISHED<i>


<img src='images/velvet_nav_unpublished.jpg'/> - Approved<br>
<img src='images/velvet_nav_published.jpg' /> - Published


Fig 1.1.Approve content (must be approved before being published)

<img width=46 src="images/velvet_nav_publish.jpg" /> Publishing occurs at the Locale level ( C. or d.1), although the button may exist at the <font style="">Segment or <font style="">Time Block level - they all do the same thing: publish the <font style="">Locale
<br>

Fig 1.2.Preview Content

<img width=46 src="images/velvet_nav_preview.jpg" /> the eye will appear active when creative (HTML) has been uploaded
<br>

Fig 1.3.Clone - make a duplicate of the content (Locale/ Template/ Ad Data) that will be independent from its original version

Fig 1.4.Archive the current location

Fig 1.5.Delete the current location

Fig 1.6.URLs - the slug, preview paths, and live paths used by the current item (<font style="">Segment or <font style="">Ad Data)

<img src="images/velvet_nav_urls.jpg" />

Fig 1.7.Edit Template - go to the template assigned to this Ad Data's locale and adjust as needed

Fig 1.8.Reset the current content

Fig 1.9.Save the current content (Ad Data/ Segment/ Time Block/ Creative/ Campaign/ Template)



Many of these functions from Fig 1.1 - Fig 1.9 are also also available inline for each item listed per Locale, Segment, or Ad Data.
Sometimes icons such, as Fig 1.6's URLs icon, for a page and not part of the list.
This happens when the list item - such as a Time Block- doesn't have unique URL information

<br>

<font style="color:#008000;">Fig 2.b.Generate Statics

<img width=46 src="images/velvet_nav_capture_static.jpg" /> the camera will appear active as long as the uploaded creative has the feature selected<br><img width=413 src="images/velvet_nav_enable_static.jpg" />
<br>

<font style="color:#008000;">Fig 2.c.Generate Videos
